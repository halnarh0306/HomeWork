"1.) Truncate Sentence You are given a sentence s and an integer k. 

You want to truncate s such that it contains only the first k words. 

Return s after truncating it.

 Input: s = ""Hello how are you Contestant"", k = 4 

Output: ""Hello how are you""

 

 2.) How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

 

 Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i . Return the answer in an array.
 

Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3] 

Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
